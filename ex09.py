# 9.Define a function, which takes a string with N opening brackets ("[") and N closing brackets ("]"), in some arbitrary order.
#   Determine whether the generated string is balanced; that is, whether it consists entirely of pairs of opening/closing brackets (in that order), none of which mis-nest.
#   Examples:
#   []        OK   ][        NOT OK
#   [][]      OK   ][][      NOT OK
#   [[][]]    OK   []][[]    NOT OK
